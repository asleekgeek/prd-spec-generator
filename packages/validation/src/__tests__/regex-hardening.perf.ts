/**
 * Growth (anti-ReDoS) assertions for the hard-output-rule patterns.
 *
 * SEPARATE FILE, AND RUN SEPARATELY — that is the point of it.
 *
 * These assert that doubling the input does not quadruple the time, which is
 * the honest way to pin "no quadratic pattern was reintroduced": a wall-clock
 * budget ("under N ms") is a flake generator on a shared runner, a growth
 * ratio is not.
 *
 * But a growth ratio is still a wall-clock measurement, and while the vitest
 * workspace runs ~97 files in parallel it is measuring the scheduler as much as
 * the code. That showed: with the assertions inside the parallel suite, the
 * `typeStartPattern` case failed roughly one full-suite run in six — on an
 * unchanged tree, at ratios just over the ceiling — while the same case
 * measured 1.87–1.95 across five trials when nothing else was running. Three
 * successive attempts to fix it in the estimator (interleaving the pair,
 * switching from the median to the fastest observation, raising the input size
 * so the work dominates GC) each reduced the rate without reaching zero,
 * because the remaining variance is contention, not method.
 *
 * So the measurement moved out of the contended environment instead:
 *
 *     pnpm test        # the parallel suite — no timing assertions
 *     pnpm test:perf   # this file, alone, its own CI step
 *
 * Excluded from the default `include` glob in packages/validation/vitest.config.ts.

/**
 * Growth ratio between `large` and `small`, taken from the FASTEST observation
 * of each size.
 *
 * The minimum, not the median, because scheduler noise and GC pauses only ever
 * ADD time: the fastest run of a fixed workload is the one least perturbed by
 * anything except the workload itself. Measured over five trials of each case
 * in this file, the median estimator produced 1.70–3.03 for `typeStartPattern`
 * and a single 11.32 outlier for the bash-function case, straddling a 2.5
 * ceiling that the underlying patterns are nowhere near — the growth is real
 * but modest (validateSection runs 44 rules over the input), and the variance
 * was the measurement's, not the code's.
 *
 * The pair is timed BACK-TO-BACK, and that is the whole point. The previous
 * implementation timed every `small` sample, then every `large` sample, so any
 * ambient-load drift between the two blocks landed entirely in the numerator.
 * With 89 test files running in parallel that drift is routine, and it made
 * this assertion fail on an UNCHANGED tree: `main` produced ratio 3.42 (ceiling
 * 2.5) on one full-suite run and passed the next two, with no quadratic pattern
 * anywhere in the diff. The file header claimed the ratio "holds regardless of
 * how loaded the machine is"; that is true of the property and was false of the
 * measurement.
 *
 * Timing both sizes adjacently also puts them under the same ambient load, so
 * the load term is common to numerator and denominator. Growth in the INPUT is
 * what survives: a quadratic worker still lands near 4x, because that factor
 * comes from the input doubling and not from the scheduler.
 *
 * source: measured pre-fix growth of the three patterns in this repo
 * (each ~3.9–4.0x per doubling; see the comments at their definitions).
