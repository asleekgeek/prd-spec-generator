/**
 * Regressions for the CodeQL regex findings closed alongside this file.
 *
 * Two kinds of assertion live here, and they are different in nature:
 *
 *  - BEHAVIOUR: two of the flagged patterns were not merely slow, they were
 *    wrong. `[:<≤<=]` never matched the `<=` operator, and the unanchored
 *    bash-function pattern matched `test_foo` inside `mytest_foo`. Those get
 *    ordinary contract tests, each of which fails on the pre-fix code.
 *
 *  - COMPLEXITY: the growth assertions that pin those same patterns as
 *    sub-quadratic live in `regex-hardening.perf.ts`, NOT here. They measure
 *    wall-clock ratios, and a wall-clock ratio taken while 96 other test
 *    files compete for the CPU is not a measurement of the code. See that
 *    file's header for what moved and why.

// The third flagged pattern, `typeKeywordPattern`, is deliberately NOT pinned

// a growth test through `validateSection` passes on the PRE-fix code too, which
// makes it a test that asserts nothing. The `(?:^|\n)` → `^` change is still
// correct (it deletes an unreachable alternative and the ambiguity CodeQL
// flagged), but the hazard it removes is latent, not live, and pretending
// otherwise with a green-either-way test would be worse than saying so.
