    // var has to be set first. That import pulls in the orchestration,
    // validation and verification trees, and the cold TypeScript transform of
    // that graph legitimately exceeds vitest's 10 s default hook timeout when
    // the workspace runs all ~97 files in parallel.
    //
    // This was flaky on `main` before the suite grew — one observed full run
    // failed 5 files, the next passed all 90 — because the default is a
    // wall-clock threshold on an operation whose duration scales with machine
    // load, not a hang. 60 s is far above the loaded-machine cost and still
    // low enough to fail fast on a genuine deadlock.
    //
    // source: measured on this workspace — the failing runs report aggregate
    // transform 201 s / import 242 s across the parallel suite; the same two
    // files complete in well under a second when run alone.
