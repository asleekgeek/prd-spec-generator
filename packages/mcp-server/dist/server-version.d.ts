 * The release version advertised to MCP hosts in `initialize`
 * (`serverInfo.version`).
 *
 * This used to be a literal in index.ts. It said `0.4.0` while package.json,
 * .claude-plugin/plugin.json, manifest.json and server.json all said `0.6.1`,
 * so every host that connected — and the MCP registry entry built from the
 * same handshake — read a version three releases stale. Nothing caught it:
 * the .mcpb smoke test printed `serverInfo.version` in its OK line without
 * asserting it, and no test pinned the literal.
 *
 * The number is therefore no longer written down twice. It is read at startup
 * from the nearest package.json that ships with the running artifact, so it
 * cannot be edited out of sync with the thing it describes.
 */

 * Advertised when no candidate manifest can be read. Deliberately not a
 * plausible-looking number: `initialize` must still succeed (a host that
 * cannot handshake gets no server at all), but a version that is silently
 * wrong is worse than one that is visibly unresolved — the first is a false
 * claim a reader acts on, the second is a bug report.
